### Changed

- Updated CodeQL workflow to use explicit `build-mode: none` for Python and
  GitHub Actions in advanced setup.
- Pinned `github/codeql-action` workflow references to full commit SHAs.
- Added workflow-level concurrency to required-check workflows so superseded
  runs are canceled on active refs.
- Added `merge_group` triggers to required-check workflows for merge-queue
  compatibility.
- Updated bootstrap automation to disable CodeQL default setup when applying
  this template, preventing advanced/default setup conflicts.
- Updated bootstrap ruleset payload to require `actionlint` and `shellcheck`.
- Updated bootstrap/ruleset generation to support opt-in required dependency
  review via `REQUIRE_DEPENDENCY_REVIEW=1`.
- Added optional CodeQL-required-check rollout via
  `REQUIRE_CODEQL_CHECKS=1` after first green CodeQL run.
- Updated bootstrap to support `RULESET_PAYLOAD_ONLY=1` for payload-only runs.

  with manual UI fallback messaging if API disable is rejected.
- Updated pre-commit hooks to include `actionlint` and `shellcheck` parity checks.
- Added a "Use This Template In 60 Seconds" section to README with a first-action
  setup path and topic guidance.
- Added harness-engineering guidance across README, AGENTS, standards, and
  contributing docs.
- Updated README and standards docs to document AGENTS pattern and CodeQL mode.
- Updated README and standards docs with current Actions SHA-pinning guidance
  and dependency review support matrix.
- Enabled repository-level Actions SHA pinning for the live template repo while
  keeping bootstrap automation docs-only for that setting.
- Updated AGENTS/CONTRIBUTING guidance with setup-trigger and quick-gate usage.
- Added SSH-first git transport guidance for Codex/headless push workflows.
- Expanded optional operations guidance with reusable workflow recommendations
  for multi-repo estates.

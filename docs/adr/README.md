# ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

Use ADRs to preserve the "why" behind durable repo decisions while keeping
active docs concise.

## Suggested format

- Filename: `ADR-XXX-short-kebab-title.md`
- Include:
  - context
  - decision
  - consequences
  - rollback/revisit criteria

## Suggested usage

- Create an ADR for policy and structure changes that are expensive to reverse.
- Keep active docs short and point to ADRs for rationale history.
